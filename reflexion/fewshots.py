WEBTHINK_SIMPLE6 = """Question: What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Thought: I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area.
Search: Colorado orogeny
Observation: The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I still don't know the exact elevation range.
Search: High Plains
Ask: What's the average elevation for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny? 
Search: High Plains (United States)
Observation: High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions. High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.


Question: Which documentary is about Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?
Ask: What's the question is asking when mentioned about documentary?
Thought: I need to search Adam Clayton Powell and The Saimaa Gesture, and find which documentary is about Finnish rock groups.
Search: Adam Clayton Powell (film)
Ask:  Could you tell me the difference among Finnish rock groups, Adam Clayton Powell or The Saimaa Gesture?
Search: The Saimaa Gesture is about Finnish rock groups.
Ask: Is documentary Adam Clayton Powell (film) a documentary about an African-American politician?
Observation: So the documentary about Finnish rock groups must instead be The Saimaa Gesture.

Previous Trial:
Statment: What is the tens digit in the sum $11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + \ldots + 11^9$? Show that it is 5.
Thought 1: We need to find the tens digit in the sum of powers of 11, from $11^1$ to $11^9$. This suggests focusing on how these powers expand and specifically, how their digits evolve, particularly the tens digit.
Action 1: Search[Break down $11^n$]
Observation 1: Noticing that higher-order terms in the expansion ($10^2$ and beyond) don't affect the tens digit simplifies the problem significantly. Only the first two terms of each expansion, $1$ and $10n$, contribute to the tens and units digits.
Thought 2: Realizing we only need to focus on the first two terms, we sum these across all powers from $11^1$ to $11^9$. This step significantly reduces the complexity of the original problem.
Action 2: Search[calculate the simplified summation: $1 + 10 + 1 + 20 + ... + 1 + 90$]
Observation 2: Observing the sum equals $459$, we understand this result is within a range that makes identifying the tens digit straightforward.
Thought 3: Knowing the sum is $459$, it's clear the tens digit is $6$. This direct observation concludes the proof process.
Action 3: Finish[First of all, we notice that $11 = 1 + 10,$ and so we write $11^n$ as follows: $$(1 + 10)^n = \binom{n}{0} \cdot 1^n + \binom{n}{1} \cdot 1^{n-1} \cdot 10^{1} + \binom{n}{2} \cdot 1^{n-2} \cdot 10^{2} + \cdots$$ We can see that every term after the first two in our expansion has at least two powers of $10,$ therefore they will not contribute to the tens digit of anything. Meanwhile, the first term is always $1,$ and the second term can be simplified to $10n.$ Therefore, we have: \begin{align*} &11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + \cdots + 11^9 \\ &\qquad\equiv (1 + 10) + (1 + 20) + \cdots + (1 + 90) \pmod{100}. \\ &\qquad\equiv 459 \equiv 59 \pmod{100}. \end{align*} Thus, the tens digit must be $6.$]

Reflection: I fail to complete the math proving with wrong calculation. The the tens digit of sum $11^1 + 11^2 + 11^3 + \ldots + 11^9$ is $5$ instead of $6$.

Previous Trial:
Statement: Find the remainder when $91145 + 91146 + 91147 + 91148$ is divided by 4. Show that it is 2.
Thought 1: We need to calculate the sum of four consecutive integers, specifically $91145 + 91146 + 91147 + 91148$
Action 1: Search[Calculate $91145 + 91146 + 91147 + 91148$.]
Observation 1: We find that the sum is $364586$.
Thought 2: Since we get the sum, we can divided by 4 and see what' the residue.
Action 2: Search[Calculate the residue of $364586$ modulo 4.]
Action 5: Finish[Calculate $91145 + 91146 + 91147 + 91148$ = $364586$. So their sum divided by 4 is 2.]

Reflection: I fail to find the common feature of the residues of the consecutive numbers that it is always a constant number 4. So i spend a lot of time to calculate the sum of the given consecutive large numbers.
