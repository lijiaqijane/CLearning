# Bot is the agent that interacts with the environment. It has the following actions:
bot.getToBlock(block_name, moveable); # move the bot to the block, where 'moveable' means whether or not the block move. Note not get into the block, but get directly adjacent to it. E.g., bot.getToBlock('stone', False) will move the bot to the nearest stone block that cannot move. E.g., bot.getToBlock('cow', True) will move the bot to the nearest stone block that can move.
bot.mineBlock(block_name); # mine the block at the bot's front. E.g., bot.mineBlock('stone') will mine the stone block at the bot's front. Note that even if you can successfully mine the block, you will not necessarily get what you want.
bot.attackMob(entity); # attack the entity. E.g., bot.attackMob('zombie') will attack the front zombie.
bot.exploreUntil(name, direction); # move the bot in the direction until the block with the name is in the view. If the move steps exceed the 10 steps limit, the bot will return 'failed'. The direction includes 'north', 'south', 'east', 'west', 'north-west', 'north-east', 'south-west', 'south-east'. E.g., bot.exploreUntil('wood', 'north') will move the bot north until the bot sees a wood block.
bot.exploreDirection(direction); # directs the bot to explore in a specified direction.. E.g., bot.exploreDirection('north') will move the bot north about 10 steps.
bot.sleep(); # put the bot to sleep.
bot.wake_up(); # wake the bot up.
bot.place_stone(); # place a stone block
bot.place_table(); # place a crafting table
bot.place_furnace(); # place a furnace
bot.place_plant(); # place a plant
bot.make_wood_pickaxe(); # craft a wood pickaxe
bot.make_stone_pickaxe(); # craft a stone pickaxe
bot.make_iron_pickaxe(); # craft an iron pickaxe
bot.make_wood_sword(); # craft a wood sword
bot.make_stone_sword(); # craft a stone sword
bot.make_iron_sword(); # craft an iron sword
